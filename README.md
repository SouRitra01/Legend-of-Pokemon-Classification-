# Project Title: Legend of Pokemon Classification using Decision Tree

## Project Overview:
I completed a project that classified Pokemon in the popular franchise, The Legend of Pokemon, using a Decision Tree algorithm. This machine learning technique was trained on a dataset of Pokemon attributes and their respective types, and then used to predict the type of new, unseen Pokemon.

## Objective:
The objective I set for myself was to build a model that accurately classifies Pokemon into their respective types, based on their attributes. I trained and tested the model on a dataset of Pokemon and their attributes, and evaluated the results to determine the accuracy of the model.

## Methodology:
Here's how I approached this project:

- Data Collection: I collected a dataset of Pokemon and their attributes from various sources.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: I cleaned and preprocessed the collected data to prepare it for modeling.
- Model Training: I trained a Decision Tree algorithm on the preprocessed data.
- Model Evaluation: I evaluated the model using accuracy metrics, such as accuracy score and confusion matrix.
- Model Deployment: I used the trained model to classify new, unseen Pokemon.

## Expected Results:
The expected results I achieved were an accurate model that can classify Pokemon into their respective types based on their attributes. I evaluated the model's accuracy and deployed it to classify new Pokemon.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, I demonstrated the capability of the Decision Tree algorithm in classifying Pokemon into their respective types based on their attributes. The results of this project I completed are useful for Pokemon fans and researchers who are interested in machine learning and data classification.
